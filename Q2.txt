objects and its internal representation in Javascript

Objects in JavaScript is it’s most important data-type and forms the building blocks for modern JavaScript. 
These objects are quite different from JavaScript’s primitive data-types(Number, String, Boolean, null, undefined and symbol) in the sense that while these primitive data-types all store a single value.

Value	     Type	                     Comment
"Hello"	    string	                "Hello" is always "Hello"
3.14	    number	                3.14 is always 3.14
true	    boolean	                true is always true
false	    boolean	                false is always false
null	    null (object)           null is always null
undefined	undefined	            undefined is always undefined
